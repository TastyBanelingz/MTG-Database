# MTG-Database
Magic the Gathering Database

##*Preface*
This is a temporary readme for this project as everything is very rough around the edges.  

##Description
This project's goal is to utilize Python and SQLite together in order to 
1. Connect to the [MTG API](https://magicthegathering.io/)
1. Consume/Process the information available using Python
1. Convert data into SQL friendly format and populate a SQLlite database for local use

##Key Scripts
This section is a work in progress...  Scripts are functional but not cleaned.  Will update when they are presentable.
